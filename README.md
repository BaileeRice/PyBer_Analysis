# PyBer_Analysis
OVERVIEW:

The premise of this challenge is to produce a DataFrame summary of ride-share data for the company PyBer. They expect a table showcasing the data by city type(Rural, Urban, Suburban) to better understand where to allocate funds/attention, as well as a multiple-line graph to better display the preformance of fares taken by city type.

The line graph does a good job of showing exactly where the market is for PyBer, with Urban cities being their core market, followed by Suburban cities and next to nobody in rural locations

The new DataFrame does a similar job, this time by showing the weekly cashflow for each city type

SUMMARY:

My first recommendation to PyBer is to maybe run in-app surveys or reviews to better understand what may be going on with the customer service out in the more rural areas, or if it's just a symptom of being out in the country so a taxi service isnt as used/useful. Running promotional events such as a few dollars off rides could do a great deal for customer aquisition and retention as well because you could intrigue someone to use the service that otherwise might not have tried it or heard of it(likely a rural customer). If the promotional events don't pan out well for attracting new rural customers, it's okay because you likely got an influx in rides from the suburban and urban categories during the promotion. My last suggestion would be to probably focus most of the funds into capturing the suburban market, they already preform very well in the urban sector so let that do its thing, something as simple as more paid advertising or hiring more drivers to make the commute for suburban homeowners more convienient and fast.

At the end of the day, it may just be a population based issue since less people are in rural areas and capital would be better put into advertising and existing customer retention.
